Serial Controller plugin for SDR#

*Note! All of this (except maybe for fancy frequency graph in SDR#) can be now achieved using great [Unitrunker](http://www.unitrunker.com/) only by itself.*

Receives frequency changes through COM port, using AR-ONE compatible protocol. Can be used to receive frequency changes from app like Unitrunker.

My initial guide how to set up all this: [HOWTO](howto/HOWTO.md)
