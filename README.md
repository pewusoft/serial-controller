Serial Controller plugin for SDR#

*Note!* All of this (except maybe for fancy frequency graph in SDR#) can be now achieved using great [Unitrunker](http://www.unitrunker.com/) only by itself.

Receives frequency changes through COM port, using AR-ONE compatible protocol. Can be used to receive frequency changes from app like Unitrunker.
